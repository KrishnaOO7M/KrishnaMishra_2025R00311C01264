    <p style="text-align: left;">Digital art encompasses a massive range of artistic expression using technology. It includes Digital Painting and Illustration, which use
         styluses and software to emulate traditional mediums on a 2D canvas. More technical forms involve Vector Art, which uses mathematical paths for infinite scalability, and Pixel Art, which focuses on a fixed, low-resolution Grid aesthetic.
<br>
The field expands into the third dimension with 3D Modeling and Sculpting for creating virtual objects and environments for games and film. Newer, dynamic forms include Generative Art (created by algorithms),
 Virtual Reality (VR) Art, and Photo Manipulation, where existing images are radically altered. Digital art's versatility allows for easy sharing, editing, and integration across various media.</p>

        <li><strong>Vector Art</strong></li>
        <p>Vector art utilizes mathematical equations to define lines, curves, and shapes, making it fundamentally different from pixel-based art. 
            This mathematical basis grants it infinite scalability without any loss of quality or resolution. Because of its crisp, clean edges, vector art is the ideal format for high-quality,
             adaptable graphics such as corporate logos, icons, and typography that must appear perfectly sharp across all sizes, from a small business card to a massive billboard.</p>

        <li><strong>Pixel Art</strong></li>
        <p>Pixel art is a distinct form of digital art where images are created and edited at the individual pixel level. Born from the hardware limitations of 8-bit and 16-bit video game consoles, it is characterized by its meticulous, blocky aesthetic and often relies on a limited color palette. 
            Every pixel is deliberately placed, much like a digital mosaic, to evoke nostalgia and achieve visually clear designs for character sprites, icons, and retro-style games.
             It celebrates artistic precision within self-imposed constraints.</p>

        <li><strong>3D Modeling</strong></li>
        <p>3D modeling is the process of creating a three-dimensional digital representation of any object or surface. It utilizes specialized software to construct a mesh of vertices, edges, and polygons that defines the object's geometry, volume, and shape.
        Key techniques include polygonal modeling for detailed surfaces and digital sculpting for organic forms. 3D models are essential across industries for VFX, animation, 3D printing, architecture visualization, and video game development.</p>

        <li><strong>Digital Painting</strong></li>
        <p>Digital painting simulates traditional art mediums like oil or watercolor using digital tools. Artists utilize a graphics tablet and stylus to paint on a computer screen, replicating brushstrokes and texture with specialized software. This method provides immense flexibility, 
            offering unlimited colors, layers, and an "undo" function, making it an efficient and expressive medium for illustration, concept art, and high-quality visual development.

        <li><strong>Photo Manipulation</strong></li>
        <p>Photo manipulation is the process of radically altering a photographic source image using digital software like Photoshop. It goes beyond simple editing to composite, remove, or add elements, fundamentally changing the scene's reality. Techniques include blending multiple photos (compositing), detailed retouching, 
            and applying filters to create surreal or hyper-realistic visuals for advertising, concept art, and fine art photography.</p>
